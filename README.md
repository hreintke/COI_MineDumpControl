## This is a Captain Of Industry Mod that includes a Mining/Dumping Building into the game.

The working is similar to the MineTower, but without the use of Trucks & Excavators.

It uses the standard Mine/Dump designations of the game, and like the MineTower an active area for where to work.

Mined/ToBeDumped resources need to transfered using belts, no possibility to use trucks.

The building is can be in Pause, Mining or Dumping state. Simultaneous mining & dumping is not possible.

The results of the mine/dump is not as clean as using trucks/excavators, for a complete flat area, a MineTower action needs to be used afterwards.
Don't know yet whether this is a good choice, but implemented this way to make it not to powerfull.

For now, there is a speedcontrol slider in the UI. 1 -> fastest, 10 -> slowest.

When the research is unlocked, the new building is available in the "Buildings" toolbar.
